## Introduction

Hello, I am **Devarshee Gaurav Das**, a data analyst with a strong foundation in SQL, Python, Power BI, and data visualization. This portfolio contains all my end-to-end data analytics projects where I analyze datasets, derive meaningful insights, and create dashboards. My goal is to provide actionable solutions to real-world problems.

## Projects

### 1. Cafe Shop Sales Analysis (SQL + Power BI)
